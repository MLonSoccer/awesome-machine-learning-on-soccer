# Awesome Machine Learning On Soccer
This repo is created to track awesome links, research papers, and open source projects related to **Machine Learning** applied to **Soccer** analytics! This list is inspired by the **[Analytics Handbook](https://github.com/devinpleuler/analytics-handbook)** created by [Devin Pleuler](https://twitter.com/devinpleuler).

## Data

The following two types of data are often used:
- **Event Data** describe on-ball events
- **Tracking Data** are records of the coordinate position of every player on the field (and usually the ball), many times per second. State-of-the-art systems collect up to 25 samples-per-second.
