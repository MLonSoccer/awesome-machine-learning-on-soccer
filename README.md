## Data

### Event Data
on-ball events

### Tracking Data
Player tracking systems record the coordinate position of every player on the field (and usually the ball), many times per second. State-of-the-art systems collect up to 25 samples-per-second.

  >  This classic 2018 OptaPro Forum talk from the effervescent [Marek Kwiatkowski](https://twitter.com/statlurker) is one of my favorites. Suggests a mixed model approach for personalizing certain soccer metrics.

- [Some Things Aren't Shots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5j-Ij5_3Cs8)
  > Great talk from [Thom Lawrence](https://twitter.com/lemonwatcher) at the 2019 StatsBomb Innovation Conference covering approaches to Expected Possession value.

- [Beyond Save Percentage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9_20e2ut14&t=1s)

##### Looking for Ideas?
I maintain a [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/devinpleuler/status/1226917827304738818) of potential ideas that I think would be interesting soccer analytics projects.
