# Machine Learning On Soccer
Awesome links, research papers, and open source projects related to Machine Learning applied to Soccer (MLonSoccer)!

## Resaerch

## Data

### Event Data
on-ball events

### Tracking Data
Player tracking systems record the coordinate position of every player on the field (and usually the ball), many times per second. State-of-the-art systems collect up to 25 samples-per-second.

##### Looking for Ideas?
I maintain a [Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/devinpleuler/status/1226917827304738818) of potential ideas that I think would be interesting soccer analytics projects.
